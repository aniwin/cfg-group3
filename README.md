# **DUMPLING**

## Game overview

**Dumpling** is a virtual pet simulation game. Players of our game will need to look after the pet by being able to 
feed, play and put their pet in sleep/awake modes. Within the game we have added a features that allows us also to play 
with our virtual pet such as rock, paper, scissors, and getting weather advice from our pet with a mini-game feature of 
guessing a city in the world where it is currently snowing.

## Planning Stage

### Tools & Skills required

We will use python to assimilate the logic of our game, including our knowledge of how to effectively use and API.
SQL knowledge will be needed for our back end database which will store name, gender and scores.

### Target Audiences

**Dumpling** is a fun game and pastime for both adults and children. The main objective of our game is for users to be 
able to raise their virtual pet to the maximum level of happiness and contentment throughout each day. Daily scores for 
games are reset at midnight every day, encouraging the user to keep playing in order to keep their pet happy and 
content.
